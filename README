Nuageux is a very simple library for ad-hoc cloud computing (i.e.,
with a set of desktop machines in a single office, and without
worrying about security/"cheating" or any sort of optimal scheduling).
Job information, data, and results are all communicated over HTTP (for
ease of debugging).  It makes use of Twisted and will eventually allow
auto-discovery of work servers using Bonjour/Zeroconf.
